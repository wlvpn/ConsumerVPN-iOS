- Added new properties to `WGPacketTunnelProvider`:
    - `lastHandshakeDate`   : `Date?` which indicates date timestamp of the last successful handshake.
    - `isInternetAvaialble` : `Bool` which indicates the current network status. 

### Removed Items

## VPNKit 7.0.0

### New Items
- Added `VPNConnectionHealthUpdateNotification` notification for WireGuard to check VPN connection is healthy or not.
- Added new properties to `Server`:
  - `scheduledMaintenanceStarts`: Date, which indicate the scheduled maintenance start time for the server.
  - `scheduledMaintenanceEnds`: Date, which indicate the scheduled maintenance end time for the server.
- It is recommended to set the `apiKey` property within the `WireGuardAdapterConfiguration` for optimal functionality.
- Added new `disconnect()` method at `WGPacketTunnelProvider` to terminate the VPN connection.
- Added new `bypassAllTraffic()` method at `WGPacketTunnelProvider` to bypass all traffic from the VPN connection.
- Added a new `isVirtualServersSkipped` property to `VPNConfiguration`, allowing the option to skip virtual server selection when connecting to the optimal location. The default value is false.
- Added new `getLastHandshake()` method at `WGPacketTunnelProvider` to retrieve the last successful handshake timestamp and current network status.
- Added new `isOnDemandEnabled` property at `WGPacketTunnelProvider` to determine if the VPN connection is on-demand.
- Introduced a new `availableEntitlements` property in `VPNAPIManager` that lists the available product entitlements.
- Added new `updateAccountConfiguration()` method at `VPNAPIManager` to update account configuraiton.
- Added new `vpnHandshakeFailureDetected()` method at `WGPacketTunnelProvider`. Subclasses can now override this method to receive notifications and handle VPN handshake failures according to their specific requirements.
- Added new `helperStatus` property at `VPNAPIManager` to determine the current status of the VPN helper installation (macOS only).
- Added new error code `VPNSystemExtensionNotInstalled`, `VPNSystemExtensionNotApproved`  on `synchronizeConfiguration` to determine the current status of the VPN helper installation (macOS only).

### Removed Items
- Removed Protocol API endpoint along with `ServerProtocol` and `ProtocolType` Models.
- Removed `icon`,`scheduledMaintenance` and 'protocols' properties from `Server` model.
- Removed `kV3InitialServersKey` and `kV3InitialProtocolsKey` keys.

### Improvements
- Updated OpenVPN documentation.
- Fixes consistency on double-hop connections.
- Fixes subsequent connection errors when the bandwidth quota is reset.
- VPN Profile(s) will only get removed during manual logout.
- Fixes crash when traffic counter active and PacketTunnelProvider gets deallocated.

  - **isMultihopEnabled** property read-only.
  - **multihopCities** contains hop cities which include also entry server. 
  - **city** property should set as exit city.
- Improves token management:
  - `Token based authentication` - Increased the coverage for the token expiration management. The SDK will keep sending `VPNLogoutSucceededNotification` which has `VPNTokenExpiredError` error as an notification object when the authentication tokens are expired/invalidated. The implementer needs to re-authenticate the user.
  - `Password based authentication` - Upon token invalidation/expiration, the SDK will attempt to re-authenticate the user using the saved email and password. If the authentication fails, will send `VPNLogoutSucceededNotification` notification which has `VPNReauthenticationFailed` error as an  notification object. The implementer needs to re-authenticate the user.
- Update all APIs version from v3.1 to v3.4.
- Resolved WireGuard Doublehop with Kill switch connection issue.
- Resolved IKEv2 / IPSec protocol all trusted WiFi + untrusted WiFi(s) on-demand connection issue.
