# Implementing Notifications
  Notifications can be integrated by conforming to the various available protocol methods in the VPNKit. Please refer to the below example implementation to get notification callbacks.

```swift
class VPNManager: NSObject, VPNStatusReporting {
    var apiManager: VPNAPIManager!

    override init() {
        super.init()
        addObservers()
    }
    
    deinit {
        removeObservers()
    }
    
    // MARK: - Observers
    func addObservers() {
        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(for: self)
    }
    
    func removeObservers() {
        NotificationCenter.default.removeObserver(for: self)
    }

}
```

# VPNHelperStatusReporting
   Implement this protocol in your VPNManager to get the status updates for Helper or System Extention Installation.

```markdown
- `statusHelperInstallSuccess`      : Notifies the receiver that the helper or system extention is installed. Includes the current VPNConfiguration.
- `statusHelperInstallPending`      : Notifies the receiver that the helper or system extention is still pending to be installed. Used to set back options to defaults or inform the user of a failure. Includes an NSError describing the issue, in case of a failure.
- `statusHelperInstallFailed`       : Notifies the receiver that the helper or system extention has failed to install. Used to set options back to defaults and inform the user of failure. Includes an NSError describing the issue.
```

Example Implementation:

```swift
  ViewController : VPNHelperStatusReporting {
   //@param notification The notification kicked back from NotificationCenter. object property holds `VPNConfiguration` type.
      func statusHelperInstallSuccess(_ notification: Notification) {
         // Handle any update in here
      }
      
      //@param notification TThe notification kicked back from NotificationCenter. Object property holds `NSError` type.
      func statusHelperInstallPending(_ notification: Notification) {
        // Handle any update in here
      }
      
      //@param notification The notification kicked back from NotificationCenter. object property holds `NSError` type.
      func statusHelperInstallFailed(_ notification: Notification) {
        // Handle any update in here
      }
  }
```

## VPNConnectionStatusReporting
    Implement this protocol in your view controller to get VPN connection status updates.

   ++Parameter++: `notification`    : The notification kicked back from the NotificationCenter. object property holds `NSError` type.
- `statusConnectionWillDisconnect`  : Notifies the receiver that the disconnection is about to begin. Use this time to prep for the disconnection and to inform the user of progress.
