// Avoid using words that describe the UI element like `Button` or `Label` and ideally should be
// a single word to describe action to users as in `Play`, `Settings`, or `Delete`

// Labels are great for non-textual pieces of UI or UI that should have more context. For instance,
// assume our app is a competitive app of some kind where we can see history of game sessions. For normal users,
// they might see `W` or `L` and associate that with `Win` or `Loss`, but a blind person may not get that same context.

/// A centralized place to store strings for accessibility identifiers so it can be used in both the application and tests.
/// These strings will be heard by visually impaired users and therefore needs to be localized.
